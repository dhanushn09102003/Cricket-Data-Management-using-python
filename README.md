This is a project done by my brother Mr.Dharun N under the guidenance of me as his class 12 final project. This project is used to store the data of the cricket match in the databse. It stores data of balls bowled, number of dot balls, runs scored by batsmen, analysis of the runs scored and many more stats as similar to the cricbuzz app.
